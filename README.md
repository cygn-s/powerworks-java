# powerworks

This is Powerworks. It is a 2d, top down, tile based game in which one builds factories. The objective is to eventually automate
the production of war robots, with which one can go into the multiplayer world and attack other's factories.

It is currently in a very basic form, with features such as:
* Two basic blocks: conveyor belt and ore miner
* Level generated using simplex noise
* Excellent event-management framework for use of plugins
* Flexible and fast rendering system, allowing on the fly scaling and modification of textures
* Utilisation of quadtrees for efficient collision detection and lookups

It will probably remain a single player game for a while as I continue to add functionality, blocks, etc.
